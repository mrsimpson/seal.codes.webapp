# Zign.codes

## Problem Statement

Digital signatures are still not widely adopted despite their importance in establishing document authenticity. Current solutions face several barriers to adoption:

1. **Technical Complexity**: Traditional digital signatures require understanding of cryptographic concepts
2. **Infrastructure Requirements**: Users need to maintain private keys or certificates
3. **Cost Barriers**: Many solutions require paid subscriptions or specialized hardware
4. **Fragmented Ecosystem**: Different document formats have different signing mechanisms
5. **Accessibility Issues**: Not everyone has access to formal digital signature tools

As a result, many people continue to share documents without proper authentication, leading to potential disputes over document origin, ownership, and integrity.

## Solution: Social Authentication-Based Document Attestation

Zign.codes provides a simple, accessible way for anyone to prove ownership of digital content by leveraging existing social identities. Rather than implementing complex cryptographic signatures, we create a verifiable attestation that links:

1. A specific document (via its cryptographic hash)
2. A user's established social identity
3. A specific point in time

This attestation is encoded in a QR code that can be attached to or embedded in the document, providing a visual indicator of verification and an easy way to check authenticity.

## How It's Different from Traditional Digital Signatures

| Feature | Traditional Digital Signatures | Zign.codes |
|---------|--------------------------------|------------|
| **Trust Model** | Based on certificate authorities and PKI | Based on social identity providers |
| **User Requirements** | Private key management | Existing social account |
| **Technical Knowledge** | Requires understanding of certificates | Minimal technical knowledge needed |
| **Verification Process** | Cryptographic verification | Social identity verification |
| **Security Level** | High cryptographic security | Social account security |
| **Revocation** | Certificate revocation lists | Based on social account access |
| **Legal Standing** | Often legally recognized | Provides evidence of association |
| **Cost** | Often requires paid services | Free or low-cost |
| **Complexity** | High | Low |

## Target Use Cases

Zign.codes is ideal for:

1. **Creative Works**: Artists, photographers, and content creators who want to establish ownership of their digital creations
2. **Informal Documents**: Agreements, proposals, and communications where full legal-grade signatures are not required
3. **Educational Materials**: Teachers and students sharing original content
4. **Social Media Content**: Establishing ownership of content before sharing on social platforms
5. **Community Contributions**: Open source contributions, community documents, and collaborative works
6. **Personal Records**: Personal documents where simple proof of origin is sufficient

## Key Benefits

- **Zero Learning Curve**: If you can log in to a social account, you can use Zign.codes
- **No New Accounts**: Uses existing social identities rather than creating new credentials
- **Self-Contained Verification**: QR codes contain all necessary verification data
- **Offline Verification**: Basic verification can be performed without internet access
- **Transparent**: Clear indication of what is being verified (social identity, not legal identity)
- **Extensible**: Framework allows for adding stronger identity providers in the future

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: User uploads a document to the Zign.codes web application
2. **Authenticate**: User logs in with their preferred social identity provider
3. **Generate**: The system creates a QR code containing:
   - A cryptographic hash of the document
   - The user's verified social identity information
   - A timestamp
   - A cryptographic signature from Zign.codes
4. **Apply**: User adds the QR code to their document
5. **Verify**: Anyone can scan the QR code to verify the document's integrity and associated social identity

## Future Extensions

While the initial implementation focuses on social authentication, the framework is designed to accommodate stronger identity verification methods in the future, such as:

- Government-issued digital IDs (like German Bund-ID)
- Professional credentials and certifications
- Organizational identity systems

## Limitations and Considerations

Zign.codes is transparent about what it does and doesn't provide:

- It verifies access to a social account at a specific time, not legal identity
- The level of trust depends on the recipient's assessment of the social identity
- It does not replace legally-binding signature requirements for formal contracts
- Security is tied to the security of the underlying social accounts
