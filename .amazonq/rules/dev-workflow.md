- If you need to understand what this project is about, check the README.md (for functional scope and ideas) and the ARCHITURE.md for technical design and implementation ideas.
- After each change in the code,
  - use the git git_add tool to add the changes to the staging area and the git_commit tool with a message of the following pattern:

  ```text
  > {{The last prompt by the user, if it's already written in an imperative style. Else or if multiple user commands were involved an imperative version of the user's intention}}

  {{A summary of the changes you performed after the last prompt and what was the reasoning behind those changes}}
  ```
