During development, you've got following tools for your assistance:

## Operating the browser: Playwright

use the playwright mcp server to interact with the app using a real browser. It allows you to open pages, inspect the DOM and even take screenshots

## Documentation: gitmcp

You will find real live documentation for some libraries and you can browse them using the mcp tools that include "_docs".
If you are not absolutely sure how to utilize them, consult the docs
