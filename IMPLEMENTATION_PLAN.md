# seal.codes Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for seal.codes, a system for creating self-contained document attestations using social authentication.

## Phase 1: Core Architecture & Interface Definition

- [ ] **1.1 Project Setup**
  - [ ] Update project name to seal.codes in package.json and configs
  - [ ] Set up basic directory structure following React best practices
  - [ ] Add minimal UI library for rapid prototyping

- [ ] **1.2 Interface Definitions**
  - [ ] Define core data interfaces (Document, Hash, Attestation, Identity)
  - [ ] Create TypeScript interface files for all major components
  - [ ] Document API contracts between frontend and backend
  - [ ] Define state management structure

- [ ] **1.3 Mock Implementation**
  - [ ] Create mock data providers for all core services
  - [ ] Implement mock authentication flow
  - [ ] Build mock document processing service
  - [ ] Set up mock attestation generation

## Phase 2: Minimal Viable Flow

- [ ] **2.1 Document Upload & Preview**
  - [ ] Implement basic file upload component
  - [ ] Create document preview functionality
  - [ ] Add simple file validation

- [ ] **2.2 Simple Hash Generation**
  - [ ] Implement basic SHA-256 hashing for documents
  - [ ] Create visual feedback for hash generation
  - [ ] Add simple hash comparison functionality

- [ ] **2.3 Authentication Skeleton**
  - [ ] Set up authentication state management
  - [ ] Implement mock social login UI
  - [ ] Create protected routes structure

- [ ] **2.4 End-to-End Flow Test**
  - [ ] Connect all components with mock data
  - [ ] Create simple attestation flow
  - [ ] Implement basic verification UI
  - [ ] Test complete user journey with mocks

## Phase 3: Core Functionality Implementation

- [ ] **3.1 Real Authentication Integration**
  - [ ] Integrate first social provider (Google)
  - [ ] Replace mock auth with real implementation
  - [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end

- [ ] **3.2 Document Processing**
  - [ ] Implement full client-side document handling
  - [ ] Add both cryptographic and perceptual hashing
  - [ ] Create hash visualization component

- [ ] **3.3 QR Code Generation**
  - [ ] Implement basic QR code generation
  - [ ] Create attestation data structure
  - [ ] Test QR code data capacity

- [ ] **3.4 Verification Prototype**
  - [ ] Build simple verification UI
  - [ ] Implement QR code scanning
  - [ ] Create verification result display

## Phase 4: Refinement & Enhancement

- [ ] **4.1 Attestation Service**
  - [ ] Implement minimal server for signing attestations
  - [ ] Create key management system
  - [ ] Connect client to attestation service

- [ ] **4.2 Document Embedding**
  - [ ] Add QR code embedding in documents
  - [ ] Implement document download functionality
  - [ ] Test embedded QR code readability

- [ ] **4.3 UI/UX Improvements**
  - [ ] Enhance user interface based on testing
  - [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
  - [ ] Add guided user flow

## Phase 5: Production Readiness

- [ ] **5.1 Security Hardening**
  - [ ] Review and enhance authentication security
  - [ ] Verify cryptographic implementation
  - [ ] Add rate limiting and abuse prevention

- [ ] **5.2 Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Optimize client-side processing
  - [ ] Improve QR code generation and scanning
  - [ ] Enhance overall application performance

- [ ] **5.3 Deployment**
  - [ ] Set up production environment
  - [ ] Configure basic monitoring
  - [ ] Deploy initial production version

## Iteration Checkpoints

After each phase, we'll conduct a review to:
- [ ] Validate assumptions and technical approaches
- [ ] Gather feedback on user experience
- [ ] Identify performance or security concerns
- [ ] Adjust subsequent phases based on learnings

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Interface-First Development**: By defining interfaces early, we can work on different components in parallel.

2. **Mock-Based Testing**: Using mocks allows us to test the complete flow before implementing all components.

3. **Incremental Feature Implementation**: Start with basic functionality and enhance iteratively.

4. **Regular Demo Points**: Create working demos at the end of each phase for stakeholder feedback.

5. **Flexible Architecture**: Design components to be replaceable as requirements evolve.
