# seal.codes Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for seal.codes, a system for creating self-contained document attestations using social authentication.

## Current Status Summary

**Major Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Complete client-side document processing with exclusion zone support
- ✅ Comprehensive QR code generation and embedding system
- ✅ Full verification workflow with hash comparison
- ✅ CBOR-based compact attestation data encoding (358 bytes, QR Version 15)
- ✅ Multi-hash approach (cryptographic + perceptual) for compression resilience
- ✅ Integration testing framework with roundtrip validation
- ✅ QR code size analysis tools with detailed component breakdown
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces and service architecture

**Key Technical Insights:**
- Fill color in exclusion zones is cryptographically significant and mandatory
- QR codes achieve 66.9% capacity utilization with reasonable physical dimensions
- Hash data dominates QR size (47.8%), suggesting optimization focus area
- Vite-node provides superior TypeScript tooling over tsx

## Iteration Checkpoints

After each phase, we'll conduct a review to:
- [ ] Validate assumptions and technical approaches
- [ ] Gather feedback on user experience
- [ ] Identify performance or security concerns
- [ ] Adjust subsequent phases based on learnings

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Interface-First Development**: By defining interfaces early, we can work on different components in parallel.

2. **Mock-Based Testing**: Using mocks allows us to test the complete flow before implementing all components.

3. **Incremental Feature Implementation**: Start with basic functionality and enhance iteratively.

4. **Regular Demo Points**: Create working demos at the end of each phase for stakeholder feedback.

5. **Flexible Architecture**: Design components to be replaceable as requirements evolve.
